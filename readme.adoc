= AWS Compute Options

This repo contains a simple application that consists of three microservices. The sample application uses three services:

. "`webapp`": Web application microservice uses "`greeting`" and "`name`"" microservice to generate a greeting for a person.
. "`greeting`": A microservice that returns a greeting.
. "`name`": A microservice that returns a personâ€™s name based upon `{id}` in the URL.

Each application is deployed using the following AWS Compute options:

. EC2
. Containers
.. Docker EE
.. Kubernetes
... BYO K8s cluster
... Amazon EKS
.. Amazon ECS
... EC2
... Fargate
. Serverless
.. AWS Lambda
.. SAM Local

Each deployment model will highlight:

. Local dev, test and debug
. How service discovery is used
. Remote debugging
. Monitoring using X-Ray

== Build and Test Services

Change to the "`services`" directory: `cd services`

. Greeting service in Terminal 1: `mvn -pl greeting wildfly-swarm:run`
.. Optionally test: `curl http://localhost:8081/resources/greeting`
. Name service in Terminal 2: `mvn -pl name wildfly-swarm:run`
.. Optionally test:
... `curl http://localhost:8082/resources/names`
... `curl http://localhost:8082/resources/names/1`
. Webapp service in Terminal 3: `mvn -pl webapp wildfly-swarm:run`
. Invoke the application in Terminal 4: `curl http://localhost:8080/`

== Build and Push Docker images

. *Create Docker image*: `mvn -pl <service> package -Pdocker` where `<service>` is `greeting`, `name` or `webapp`
. *Docker image name*: By default, the Docker image name is `arungupta/<service>`. Create the image in your repo as: `mvn -pl <service> package -Pdocker -Ddocker.repo=<repo>`
. *Push Docker images to registry*:
+
```
docker push <repo>/greeting
docker push <repo>/name
docker push <repo>/webapp

```
+
This is a workaround until https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-compute-options/issues/4 is fixed.

== Deploy Application to Kubernetes

This repo will use Helm charts to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.

Make sure `kubectl` CLI and is configured for the Kubernetes cluster. Also, make sure Helm is installed on that Kubernetes cluster.

. Create Helm chart: `helm install --name myapp app-helm`
. Delete Helm chart: `helm delete --purge myapp`

Accessing the application will not work because of https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-compute-options/issues/6.
